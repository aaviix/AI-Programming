## Question 2
# The Fibonacci series 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, . . . is generated by starting with 0, 1 and then each subsequent number is the sum of the two previous ones. Write a recursive function fib(n) that calculates the nth item of the Fibonacci series starting with 0, e.g. fib(6) should return 8. Donâ€™t try to be efficient! Actually, how could you be more efficient?

def fib(n):
    # Base case: if n is 0 or 1, return n
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    # Recursive case: calculate Fibonacci number using recursion
    else:
        return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2)

# Example usage:
result = fib(6)
print(result)  # Output: 8 (since fib(6) = 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8)
